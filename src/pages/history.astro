      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        tim.js started in 2013. The first event, simply called <a
          class="underline text-blue-500"
          href="https://www.meetup.com/tim-js/events/123239412/"
          target="_blank">First Meetup</a
        >, took place on <strong>June 19th 2013</strong>, with more than 30
        attendees, on a Wednesday evening at 18:30. To this day, all the
        following meetups, with very few exceptions, took place on Wednesdays at
        18:30.

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        The meetup was initially organized by <strong>Raul Ciotescu</strong> and
        <strong>Cassian Lup</strong> from Netzinkubator, which had their office within
        the <a
          href="https://www.facebook.com/700StartupHub/"

      </p>

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        During the first few meetups, the group didn't even have an actual name.
        However, the 8th event showcases the meetup has finally got it's name: <strong
          >tim.js</strong
        >, which is short for
        <strong>Timisoara JavaScript Group</strong>. This name was chosen after
        a vote of the community from a few other choices.
      </p>

      <br />

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        For many years, the meetups took place within the offices of the
        companies that supported the event: <strong>[e-spres-oh]</strong>, <strong
          >3 Pillar Global</strong
        >, and
        <strong>Netzinkubator</strong> at Startup Hub.

      <h2 class="font-bold text-5xl text-gray-800">Past supporters</h2>

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Once we've reached a certain numbers of active users, the Start Hub
        didn't support us anymore, considering that we're mature enough to get
        support from elsewhere and leave the space for others meetups and events
        to be born.
      </p>

      <p class="text-xl leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Therefore, over the years we got support from many local companies which
        sponsored one or more tim.js events: <strong>Irian</strong>, <strong
          >WeVideo</strong
        >, <strong>Visma</strong>, <strong>Victory Square Partners</strong>, <strong
          >Ness</strong
        >.

        Thank you all on the behalf of the JavaScript community.
