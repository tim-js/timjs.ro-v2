          The regular audience is quite diverse. There are core members that
          attend the meetup every month, since the beginning. Others that attend
          only now and then, when they see interesting topics on the agenda.

          with decades of experience, and everything in between.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
          We address the entire JavaScript ecosystem, including but not limited
          to: User Interfaces/Frontend, Node.js/Backend,
          web/mobile/desktop/hardware, standard APIs/ES/DOM,
          libraries/frameworks, practices/patterns/paradigms/concepts etc.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-2">
          We don't specifically focus on HTML or CSS, but since they are closely
          related to UI/Frontend development, they are not out-of-scope.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500 mt-2">
          We don't focus on other languages that compile to JavaScript, such as
          ScalaJS, ClojureScript, Reason, Elm, etc. as it would widen our focus
          too much. Exceptions are JS supersets and type checkers like
          TypeScript or Flow.
