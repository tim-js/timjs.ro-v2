Building one, however, might be scary, when in fact you just need to start somewhere and go from there. This presentation aims to give you the basics and a kick in the right direction.\n\n---\n\n➡️ The flavors of design - why should anyone care about them?\n\nConsidering the ever changing job titles, continuous confusion, search for design unicorns that fail to appear, and constant belief that we are all artists at heart, I would like to discuss how different & not necessarily good at everything we all are and why that is a good thing.\n\nWhat is the presentation about?\nRaising awareness about the different design roles, goals, capabilities & processes. Highlighting the value we can bring to the teams & projects. Describing what motivates us, drives our decisions and all the aspects that we need to balance.\n\nWhy is this relevant?\nIt’s an opportunity to discuss things that can improve the designer-developer collaboration, by removing assumptions & aligning expectations; as well as facilitate communication by speaking in terms that we all understand & care about.\n\n---\n\nNOTE: We are always looking for speakers, so please send us your proposals.",

In this talk, we are going to look at module federation and how multiple builds can form a single application. A short practical demo will be included along with discussions about use cases to better understand when and where we might want to use it.\n\nℹ️ Simple vs. Easy\n\nSimple solutions usually require a lot of effort during their usage, but they also provide a high level of control. Complex solutions are usually easy to use, but retain the control for themselves. This theory applies both at high-level architecture and also at low-level, day-to-day code design.\n\nWe'll explore different methods for tackling software complexity, by deeply understanding our users and deciding where to place the control: in the implementation, or in the consumer.\n\n---\n\nNOTE: We are always looking for speakers, so please send us your proposals at **contact@timjs.ro**.",

In this talk we'll see some practical examples where we might have to temporarily skip type-checking, debating the lesser known \\`ts-expect-error\\` directive against the popular \\`ts-ignore\\`.\n\n**2️⃣ Lessons from 200 Million Lines of Code**\nCome and join me on a journey of tackling an atypical business requirement: reading 200 million lines of code. We’ll dig deeper into the why and the how. We’ll look behind the curtains of GitHub’s UI, we’ll talk about code complexity and we’ll implement a tool that can analyze any repository. We’ll use a little bit of scripting, containerisation and Node.js.\n\nWe’ll talk about what good product development looks like and we’ll hopefully leave this session more motivated to grow in our joined passion for developing great digital products. See you Wednesday!\n\n\\-\\-\\-\nNOTE: We are always looking for speakers, so please send us your proposals at **contact@timjs.ro**.",

Powering UI with Utilities**\nZoltán Szőgyényi - Co-founder and CEO at Bergside\n\nIn this talk you will learn the advantages and disadvantages of working with a utility-first CSS framework called Tailwind CSS and how this can improve communication between developers and even across companies. You'll also learn how you can use open-source UI component libraries to your advantage similar to Bootstrap but with the utility-first approach in your HTML and components.\n\n**2\\. SRP in depth**\nAndrei Pfeiffer - Code Designer @ Smilecloud\n\nThe Single Responsibility Principle, the first of the SOLID principles, is most likely the most subtle and difficult to detect. We'll experience an evolving piece of code and debate at which exact moment the SRP violation occurred and refactor our code accordingly. Lastly, we'll take a look at two real-life case studies and exemplify how we can detect potential SRP issues, before writing the actual code.\n\n✉️ We are always looking for speakers.

We'll be waiting for you at doctari on March 20th for another two awesome presentations:\n\n**1️⃣ Uniting Frontend and Backend: Sharing Code with NPM Packages**\nNarcis Gherasim - Senior Fullstack Developer with React Focus @ doctari group technologies\n\nHey there, fellow devs! Let’s dive into the world of NPM packages and how they can help us share code between frontend and backend development. We promise, no boring lectures, just practical tips and tricks!\n\n**2️⃣ Technical leadership for individual contributors**\nAdrian Fâciu - Principal Engineer @ WeVideo\n\nTechnical leadership is something expected from all engineers, especially from senior and above levels. And, most of the activities associated with technical leadership do not involve writing any code. So how do we handle this? Especially since our main job for the past decade was to write code… How do we increase our impact? How can we create a technical backlog and a technical strategy to guide us? In this talk, I will try to expand a bit on these topics and give some other practical examples of technical leadership initiatives. You should leave this talk better equipped to handle positions that require technical leadership, or at least, with a better understanding of what technical leadership is.\n\nWe are always looking for speakers, so please send us your proposals at **contact@timjs.ro**.\n\n*Please note that you will be asked to fill in a form at the front desk, to gain access into the building, so you might want to come a few minutes earlier.*",

    "description": "Hello scripters,\n\nTime to meet again! This time we're gathering at our friends at Haufe Group for two presentations:\n\n1️⃣ **SRP vs OCP vs ISP**\n\\-\\- Andrei Pfeiffer\n\nIn this talk, we'll focus on 3 of the SOLID principles: SRP (the Single Responsibility Principle), OCP (the Open-Closed Principle), and ISP (the Interface Segregation Principle). While there are clear differences between the 3, they all share the same solution, which is the reason why we explore them together.\n\nWe'll see when each of the 3 principles are usually violated, what are the potential problems, how to identify them, and last but not least, how to solve them. No slides, just code and practical examples.\n\n2️⃣ **Introduction to WebRTC**\n\\-\\- Robert Todea\n\nIn this tech talk, we'll explore the fundamentals of WebRTC, a powerful protocol that enables seamless audio, video, and data exchange directly between browsers. Discover how WebRTC revolutionizes online interactions, making way for innovative applications.\n\nKey Points:\n(1) Understanding WebRTC: What it is, its core components, and how it establishes peer-to-peer connections.\n(2) The Power of Real-Time: Explore exciting use cases ranging from video conferencing and live streaming to online gaming and collaboration tools.\n(3) Scaling with MediaSoup: Learn how MediaSoup, a flexible server-side framework, allows you to build complex, large-scale WebRTC applications with advanced features.\n\n*We're always looking for new speakers.

    "description": "Hello javascripters, it's time to meet up again. This time, our host will be Haufe Group. Here's the agenda:\n\n**1️⃣ Schema Driven Development**\nCiprian Caba\n\nDo you ever grow tired of managing types, data models, database migrations, runtime validations, api endpoints, openapi schemas? What if there was a better way to manage them so you can actually focus on functionality rather than chores?\n\nLet’s build a simple app and explore how using one single source of truth can make everything better\n\n**2️⃣ Modern HTTP Streaming using Web Standards**\nAndrei Pfeiffer\n\nFew things are more annoying than waiting for a heavy webpage to load and not seeing any visual progress. Using async requests, we can lazy load the heavy content, displaying the rest of the page to the user sooner and introducing visual indicators to suggest loading progress. However, since serving the initial page is the server’s job, we’ll analize various methods to place the control back in the server regarding initial page rendering. We’ll examine how popular frameworks perform SSR Streaming, but also showcase a novel proof of concept using Declarative Shadow DOM to load webpages progressively, out of order, and without JavaScript.\n\nThis talk is a fully hands-on demo, exploring multiple approaches to loading heavy content on Server-Side Rendered webpages. The demo includes minimal complexity, using only Express.js and native APIs. No frameworks, no libraries, just vanilla code for everyone to understand. However, this talk is not limited to Node.js. Everything we’ll cover equally applies to any server-side programming language.\n\n***\n\n*We're always looking for new speakers.
